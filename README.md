Have you ever wanted to volunteer on a free weekend but had no idea how to get started? Or perhaps you are a part of a non-profit that could do with more people to help? 🤝

Presenting **Volunteery**, the solution to all the times you want to do some good. ✨

## 🙋 So, how does it work?
It's simple! You sign in as a volunteer or non-profit manager - and depending on your role, you can find new places to volunteer at, or add new events for people to find! 🔎

## 👨‍🏭 Who are we?
This project was built by Pod 1.1.3 Team 1, [AB Satyaprakash](https://github.com/imperial-lord), [Preet Shah](https://github.com/shahpreetk), [Shambhavi Aggarwal](https://github.com/agg-shambhavi) and [Ankit Maity](https://github.com/QEDK).

## 💻 What did we build this with?
Volunteery is completely made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). 🎐 And for all our backend services, Volunteery uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). 🔥

## 🔧 Installation
You will need to have Flutter installed, if you haven't done that yet - get started [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Then, follow the steps below. ⬇

### 🧱 Building from source
If you're using an IDE like Android Studio, this can probably be done easily using the GUI/hotkeys, but if you like the terminal more (as we do 👌):
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:QEDK/volunteery.git
$ cd volunteery
$ flutter run
```
You should then be able to select from a list of available build options - and that's it! 💯

### ➕ Other modes
By default, Flutter will make the builds in debug mode, if you want to publish a release or profile your app, always ensure you make the build in the correct mode like:
```bash
$ flutter run --release
$ flutter run --profile
```

## 🔜 What's next?
* Integrate our service with educational institutions which have credits for social work. 🏫
* Make a custom ML-assisted algorithm for the best outcomes. 🤖
* Gamify the experience with badges, ranks and custom merch. 👕

Where we want to be:
* An integrated end-to-end platform between volunteers and non-profits. 🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏿
